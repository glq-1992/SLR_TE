This repo holds codes of the paper: Visual Alignment Constraint for Continuous Sign Language Recognition.(ICCV 2021) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02330)

---
### Prerequisites

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (>1.8). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)ï¼Œfor beam search decode.

- [Optional] sclite [[kaldi-asr/kaldi]](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi), install kaldi tool to get sclite for evaluation. After installation, create a soft link toward the sclite:    
  `ln -s PATH_TO_KALDI/tools/sctk-2.4.10/bin/sclite ./software/sclite`
  We also provide a python version evaluation tool for convenience, but sclite can provide more detailed statistics.

- [Optional] [SeanNaren/warp-ctc](https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc) At the beginning of this research, we adopt warp-ctc for supervision, and we recently find that pytorch version CTC can reach similar results.

### Data Preparation

1. Download the CCUL Dataset [[download link]](https://github.com/glq-1992/CCUL_all/tree/main).

### Training

The priorities of configuration files are: command line > config file > default values of argparse. To train the SLR model on CCUL, run the command below:

`python main_EinT_2d.py --device 0


### To Do List

- [x] Pure python implemented evaluation tools.
- [x] WAR and WER calculation scripts.
